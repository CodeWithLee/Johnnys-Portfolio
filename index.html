          Hello, My name is Johnny Jones. My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been transformative both personally and professionally. Developing my ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on the full range of skills I have gained and how they shape my goals as I prepare to begin my career in the field. Throughout the program, I learned how to combine creativity, problem solving, and technical discipline to build software that is both functional and engaging. This process helped me understand my strengths, refine my values, and become more confident and employable as a future front-end engineer.
          My background in graphic design played a major role in guiding me toward front end development. Before studying computer science, I spent years designing visuals, layouts, and brand identities. This taught me how to think about user experience, accessibility, and visual communication. When I began writing code, I realized that front end engineering allowed me to merge my creativity with my interest in technology. Courses such as Mobile Architecture and Programming and Object-Oriented Design showed me how to turn a visual idea into an actual working interface. This connection between design and development is what motivates me and continues to shape my professional goals.
          Throughout the program I learned how essential collaboration and communication are in software development. Team based assignments required me to explain technical decisions clearly, participate in planning, and write code that others could understand and build upon. Even when working individually, I learned how to treat stakeholders as part of the development process by writing organized documentation, presenting ideas effectively, and incorporating feedback. These experiences strengthened my ability to work in environments where communication is just as important as writing code.
          I also grew significantly in my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms taught me how to evaluate the efficiency of different approaches and choose the best solution for a problem. These principles carried into other projects where I needed to organize information, process data efficiently, or calculate results accurately. Learning how algorithms impact performance made me a more thoughtful and intentional developer.
          Software engineering became another major area of growth. I learned how to follow the software development lifecycle, create clear requirements, plan enhancements, and develop maintainable code. Working through larger projects taught me the importance of modular design, version control, and testing. These experiences prepared me for real world development where organization and maintainability matter just as much as getting the application to work.
          The program also strengthened my understanding of databases. I learned how to write SQL queries, design schemas, normalize data, and connect applications to persistent storage. In later courses I expanded these skills by working with full stack projects that required both backend logic and user facing features. Understanding how data flows between an interface and a database helped me build more complete and reliable applications.
          Security was another key component of my education. Through courses such as Secure Coding, I learned how vulnerabilities are introduced and how to protect applications from common exploits. I began to view security as part of the design process rather than something added at the end. This mindset has influenced the way I validate inputs, manage user data, and structure my code.
          Bringing all of this together in my ePortfolio helped me see how much progress I have made. The artifacts I selected represent my strengths in front end engineering, problem solving, database handling, and applying algorithmic thinking. Together they show how I approach software from multiple angles, including user experience, logic, architecture, and data. The enhancements I made for this capstone demonstrate my ability to analyze code, identify opportunities for improvement, and apply skills I learned throughout the program.
          My portfolio tells the story of my growth from a designer with an interest in technology to a software developer who can build complete solutions. It introduces the projects that shaped me, explains the skills I have gained, and presents the work I am most proud of. More importantly, it reflects the kind of professional I am becoming. I value creativity, clear communication, and building software that is both effective and enjoyable to use. This program has prepared me for the next step in my career, and I feel ready to bring these strengths into the field of computer science.

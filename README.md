## Overview

This repository contains my Computer Science ePortfolio, created as the capstone project for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. It brings together my academic work, technical projects, and written reflections to show how my skills have developed throughout the program.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my readiness to enter the software engineering field, with a particular focus on front-end development, software design, problem solving, and writing maintainable, well-structured code.

## Professional Self Assessment

Hello, my name is Johnny Jones. My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been transformative both personally and professionally. Developing this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to reflect on the full range of skills I gained throughout the program and how they shape my goals as I begin my career in the field. Throughout my coursework, I learned how to combine creativity, problem solving, and technical discipline to build software that is both functional and engaging. This process helped me better understand my strengths, refine my values, and become more confident and employable as a future front-end engineer.

My background in graphic design played a major role in guiding me toward front-end development. Before studying computer science, I spent years designing visuals, layouts, and brand identities, which taught me how to think critically about user experience, accessibility, and visual communication. When I began writing code, I realized that front-end engineering allowed me to merge my creativity with my interest in technology. Courses such as Mobile Architecture and Programming and Object-Oriented Design showed me how to turn a visual idea into a working interface. That connection between design and development continues to motivate my professional goals.

Throughout the program, I also strengthened my collaboration, communication, and analytical skills. Team-based assignments required me to explain technical decisions clearly, participate in planning, and write code that others could understand and build upon. I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, software engineering principles, databases, and secure coding practices. Bringing all of this together in my ePortfolio helped me see how much progress I have made. This portfolio represents the work I am most proud of from the program and reflects the kind of professional I am becoming as I prepare to enter the field of computer science.

## Featured Project

### Revolv 360 – Android Weight Tracking Application

Revolv 360 is a mobile weight tracking application that allows users to log daily weight entries, view historical trends, track progress toward goals, and receive motivational feedback. The project was originally developed in CS 360 and later enhanced as part of my CS 499 capstone to demonstrate growth across multiple computer science competencies.

---

## Capstone Enhancements

### Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

For my first enhancement, I improved the software engineering and design aspects of the Revolv 360 application by implementing a full dark mode toggle. The original version of the app relied on a single static theme, which limited accessibility and did not reflect modern user interface standards. I redesigned the theme architecture so users could switch between light and dark mode, with all screens updating instantly based on the selected preference.

This enhancement required refactoring UI components, updating color resources, managing shared theme state, and ensuring that user preferences persist across sessions. Completing this enhancement allowed me to apply software design principles while improving maintainability and usability. It also reflects my growth as a front-end developer who balances technical implementation with user-centered design.

---

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The second enhancement focused on expanding application functionality through algorithmic logic and data handling. I implemented a weekly weight change badge that calculates a user’s progress over a seven-day period. While the original application stored weight entries, it did not provide analytical feedback based on that data.

To implement this feature, I designed logic to identify the correct date range, retrieve relevant entries, perform accurate calculations, and update the user interface dynamically as data changed. This process strengthened my understanding of algorithms, list processing, conditional logic, and data validation. The enhancement shows how well-designed algorithms and appropriate data structures can directly improve functionality and user engagement.

---

### Enhancement Three: Databases

For the third enhancement, I expanded the database functionality of the application by adding support for notes associated with each weight entry. In the original version, the database stored only a single numeric value per day, which limited the usefulness of the stored data.

I modified the data model to include a notes field and updated the logic for creating, editing, and retrieving entries. This enhancement shows my ability to design and evolve database structures while maintaining data integrity and reliability. It also demonstrates my understanding of how data flows from user input through persistent storage and back into the user interface.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as both an academic artifact and a professional portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to analyze existing software, implement meaningful enhancements, apply core computer science concepts, and clearly communicate technical decisions.

I built this portfolio to show how my skills have grown over time and how I approach real software problems from both a technical and user-focused perspective.

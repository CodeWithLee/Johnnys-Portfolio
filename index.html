          Hello, My name is Johnny Jones. My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been transformative both personally and professionally. Developing my ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on the full range of skills I have gained and how they shape my goals as I prepare to begin my career in the field. Throughout the program, I learned how to combine creativity, problem solving, and technical discipline to build software that is both functional and engaging. This process helped me understand my strengths, refine my values, and become more confident and employable as a future front-end engineer.
          My background in graphic design played a major role in guiding me toward front end development. Before studying computer science, I spent years designing visuals, layouts, and brand identities. This taught me how to think about user experience, accessibility, and visual communication. When I began writing code, I realized that front end engineering allowed me to merge my creativity with my interest in technology. Courses such as Mobile Architecture and Programming and Object-Oriented Design showed me how to turn a visual idea into an actual working interface. This connection between design and development is what motivates me and continues to shape my professional goals.
          Throughout the program I learned how essential collaboration and communication are in software development. Team based assignments required me to explain technical decisions clearly, participate in planning, and write code that others could understand and build upon. Even when working individually, I learned how to treat stakeholders as part of the development process by writing organized documentation, presenting ideas effectively, and incorporating feedback. These experiences strengthened my ability to work in environments where communication is just as important as writing code.
          I also grew significantly in my understanding of data structures and algorithms. Courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms taught me how to evaluate the efficiency of different approaches and choose the best solution for a problem. These principles carried into other projects where I needed to organize information, process data efficiently, or calculate results accurately. Learning how algorithms impact performance made me a more thoughtful and intentional developer.
          Software engineering became another major area of growth. I learned how to follow the software development lifecycle, create clear requirements, plan enhancements, and develop maintainable code. Working through larger projects taught me the importance of modular design, version control, and testing. These experiences prepared me for real world development where organization and maintainability matter just as much as getting the application to work.
          The program also strengthened my understanding of databases. I learned how to write SQL queries, design schemas, normalize data, and connect applications to persistent storage. In later courses I expanded these skills by working with full stack projects that required both backend logic and user facing features. Understanding how data flows between an interface and a database helped me build more complete and reliable applications.
          Security was another key component of my education. Through courses such as Secure Coding, I learned how vulnerabilities are introduced and how to protect applications from common exploits. I began to view security as part of the design process rather than something added at the end. This mindset has influenced the way I validate inputs, manage user data, and structure my code.
          Bringing all of this together in my ePortfolio helped me see how much progress I have made. The artifacts I selected represent my strengths in front end engineering, problem solving, database handling, and applying algorithmic thinking. Together they show how I approach software from multiple angles, including user experience, logic, architecture, and data. The enhancements I made for this capstone demonstrate my ability to analyze code, identify opportunities for improvement, and apply skills I learned throughout the program.
          My portfolio tells the story of my growth from a designer with an interest in technology to a software developer who can build complete solutions. It introduces the projects that shaped me, explains the skills I have gained, and presents the work I am most proud of. More importantly, it reflects the kind of professional I am becoming. I value creativity, clear communication, and building software that is both effective and enjoyable to use. This program has prepared me for the next step in my career, and I feel ready to bring these strengths into the field of computer science.

                Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design
              </p>

              <div class="work__narrative scroll-box">
                <p>
                  For my first enhancement, I improved the software engineering and design aspects of my Android Weight Tracker application by implementing a full dark mode toggle. The original version of the app used a single static theme, which limited user accessibility and did not reflect modern design standards. To address this, I created a dynamic theme system that allows users to switch between light mode and dark mode, with the entire interface updating instantly based on the selected preference. This enhancement required restructuring several UI components, adjusting color resources, updating composables to support theme states, and ensuring that all screens including the add weight screen and the alerts screen responded correctly to theme changes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Completing this enhancement allowed me to demonstrate strong skills in software design, UI architecture, and state management within Android development. I worked with theme layers, color palettes, and Material Design principles to ensure visual consistency across the app. I also integrated persistent user settings, allowing the selected theme to remain active even after the application is closed. This required careful planning and refactoring, since multiple screens needed to share logic and respond to a unified theme state without breaking existing functionality. Implementing a system wide dark mode showed my ability to coordinate UI elements, maintain clean design patterns, and improve user experience through thoughtful interface customization.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This enhancement aligns with the course outcomes focused on applying software engineering principles and designing computing solutions using industry standard techniques. By adding a dynamic theme system, I demonstrated the ability to structure software for long term maintainability, improve usability, and incorporate modern design features that enhance accessibility. The dark mode toggle reflects my ability to modify an existing project using well founded engineering practices, improving both the visual design and the underlying architecture of the application. It also illustrates my growth as a front end developer who can blend technical implementation with user centered design.

                Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
              </p>

              <div class="work__narrative scroll-box">
                <p>
                  For my second enhancement, I expanded the functionality of my Android Weight Tracker application by implementing a weekly weight change badge. The original app allowed users to enter, edit, and delete weight entries, but it did not provide immediate feedback or analysis based on the data the user provided. To improve the experience, I created a feature that calculates the user’s weight difference over the past seven days and displays a badge that reflects their progress. This enhancement required designing the logic to identify the correct date range, retrieve the appropriate data, compute the weekly change, and update the badge automatically whenever new entries were added or modified.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Developing this feature allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of algorithms and data structures within a real application. I improved the way the app stores and processes weight entries by using cleaner data handling methods and more efficient calculations. Creating the badge required careful control of lists, indexing, conditional checks, and data validation to ensure the results were accurate. I also refined the update logic so that the badge refreshes properly when entries change, which strengthened the connection between the user interface and the underlying data management. Working through these steps helped me apply algorithmic thinking, improve the internal structure of my app, and ensure that the badge feature is both reliable and responsive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This enhancement aligns with the course outcomes that focus on applying algorithmic strategies and selecting appropriate data structures to solve computing problems. By designing a calculation process that evaluates user data, identifies patterns, and presents feedback in a meaningful way, I demonstrated my ability to create efficient logic that enhances the functionality of the application. The weekly weight change badge shows how well constructed algorithms can support user goals and improve the overall value of a software system. This enhancement also reflects my growth as a developer who can integrate practical data processing techniques into user centered features.

                Enhancement Three: Databases
              </p>

              <div class="work__narrative scroll-box">
                <p>
                  For this milestone, I focused on improving the database portion of my weight tracking application by adding support for storing notes alongside each weight entry. The original version of the app only saved a single value for each day, which was the user’s weight. There was no way to include additional information such as how the user was feeling, what they ate, or what might have affected their progress. As a result, the data did not tell the full story of the user’s journey. I created the updated notes feature to give the database structure more depth and to make the stored information more meaningful.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The enhancement required me to modify the data model and update how entries were created, stored, and retrieved. I added a notes field to the WeightEntry data class and updated the logic that manages weight entries so the notes would be saved and displayed correctly. This meant rewriting parts of the code responsible for adding new entries, editing existing entries, and loading them into the user interface. Before this change, the app only saved one simple value for each day. Now it organizes multiple pieces of related information for each entry, which gives the app a more realistic data structure and shows that I can work with richer, more complex persistent data.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This enhancement aligns with the course outcomes related to designing, implementing, and managing data storage solutions that support application requirements. By expanding the database structure and ensuring that the notes are reliably stored and retrieved, I demonstrated my ability to maintain data integrity while evolving an existing system. I also showed that I can trace how information flows from user input through the data model and back into the user interface. The notes feature strengthens the overall usefulness of the application and highlights my ability to extend database driven components in a thoughtful, maintainable way.
